# MIT Applied Data Science Course Projects

## About
Several guided projects completed through the MIT Applied Data Science course. These projects contained varying levels of directions & partially completed code depending on which phase of the course they were created in. The malaria image detection neural network was the capstone project for the course, so was the least guided of any of the projects.
